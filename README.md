State-of-the-art models for medical image segmentation achieve excellent accuracy but require substantial computational resources, limiting deployment in resource-constrained clinical settings. We present SegMate, an efficient 2.5D framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while considerably reducing computational requirements. Our efficient design is the result of meticulously integrating asymmetric architectures, attention mechanisms, multi-scale feature fusion, slice-based positional conditioning, and multi-task optimization. We demonstrate the efficiency-accuracy trade-off of our framework across three modern backbones (EfficientNetV2-M, MambaOut-Tiny, FastViT-T12). We perform experiments on three datasets: TotalSegmentator, SegTHOR and AMOS22. Compared with the vanilla models, SegMate reduces computation (GFLOPs) by up to 2.5× and memory footprint (VRAM) by up to 2.1×, while generally registering performance gains of around 1%. On TotalSegmentator, we achieve a Dice score of 93.51% with only 295MB peak GPU memory. Zero-shot cross-dataset evaluations on SegTHOR and AMOS22 demonstrate strong generalization, with Dice scores of up to 86.85% and 89.35%, respectively.
